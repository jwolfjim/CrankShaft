# Use these files to create a module with sliding padding, margin, and custom css input. It works better than the existing Hubspot tool if used correctly. 


## To use:

1. Copy the advanced features boilerplate code into a new module.
2. Change your fields.json file to match the one in this parent folder.
3. Enjoy sliding margin and padding bliss.
